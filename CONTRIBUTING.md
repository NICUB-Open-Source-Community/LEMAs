Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the people managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

We follow the standard Git workflow of fork -> change -> pull request -> merge -> update fork -> change ... (repeat forever). If you are new to open source, we recommend GitHub's excellent guide on "How to Contribute to Open Source". In addition, please feel free to reach out to any of the maintainers or other community members if you are struggling; we are here to help you learn!

# Getting Started
## Opening an issue
If you're experiencing an issue with CHAOSS Slack Bot or have a question you'd like help answering, please feel free to open an issue. To help us prevent duplicates, we kindly ask that you briefly search for your problem or question in our issues before opening a new one.
Please note that if you open a bug report, we cannot help you until you have provided us with all the relevant information. Respectfully, we do not have the time to try and recreate an error given with minimal or no context, so by providing this information you are helping us help you! Provide descriptions to the best of your ability, and please include screenshots and error logs if applicable.
